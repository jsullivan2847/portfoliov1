### Hi there 👋


How’s it going! My name is James, I’m a software engineer, I just completed a coding bootcamp at general assembly. My journey started a few years ago when I was studying sound design for game audio and realized that I really enjoyed the programming side of things, I taught myself a C# via game design and soon after decided to make the career switch to coding. To me it came naturally, I love making things, testing them out, perfecting them. In my time before this I spent a lot of time as a touring musician, and working  in kitchens, where the pressure is high and things move very fast. From that I bring a great sense of urgency and ability to work with any team no matter what the struggle is.
