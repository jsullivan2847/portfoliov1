### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is James, I'm a software engineer with a background in audio. I've just completed a coding bootcamp at General Assembly and I'm currently looking for work. A few years I taught myself C# through the Unity game engine and discovered my love for coding. To me it came naturally, I love making things, testing them out, and working out problems in code. In my time before this I spent a lot of time as a touring musician, playing and producing music and working in kitchens, where the pressure is high and things move very fast. From that I bring a great sense of urgency and ability to work with any team no matter what the challenge.
